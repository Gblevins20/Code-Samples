# Game-Jam-Entries
This is part Portfolio/part place where I can keep track of the games I've made.
It will also contain non-game programs as their made.

The Scheduler.ccp mimics the function of a system scheduler. It does so by construction a text file so that it has 3 separate queues that are initially empty. Afterwards, it fills the queues from a randomized list of jobs that each have their own priority. After filling all three queues, it passes the queue to the job processor which runs the queues based on the queue order defined in the processor. The project was to be used in conjunction with the program, wireshark, in order to witness its output.
